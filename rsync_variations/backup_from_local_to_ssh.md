This script has the following features:

- The source and destination variables are used to specify the source and destination directories for the rsync command. You can modify these variables to specify the appropriate directories for your specific setup.
- The rsync command uses the -a option to enable "archive" mode, which preserves symbolic links, file permissions, timestamps, and other metadata. It also uses the -v option to enable "verbose" mode, which displays detailed information about the files being transferred. The -r option enables "recursive" mode, which tells rsync to copy directories and their contents recursively. Finally, the -e /usr/bin/ssh option specifies that rsync should use SSH to transfer the files.
- To use this script, you can save it to a file (e.g. backup.sh) and make it executable using the chmod command, like this: chmod +x backup.sh.
