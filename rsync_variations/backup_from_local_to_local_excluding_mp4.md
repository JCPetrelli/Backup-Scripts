- In this script, the --exclude=*.mp4 option tells rsync to exclude any files that end with the .mp4 extension from the backup. You can use this option to exclude any other types of files that you don't want to include in the backup.

- You can use this script in the same way as the example in the file 'backup_from_local_to_local.sh': save it to a file, make it executable, and then run it.
