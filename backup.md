- This script uses rsync to perform a full backup of the src directory to the dest directory. It accepts the src and dest directories as arguments when the script is run. The -a option tells rsync to copy files in a recursive manner, preserving the file permissions and ownership. The -v option enables verbose output so you can see the progress of the backup. The -z option enables compression, which can speed up the transfer of files over the network.
