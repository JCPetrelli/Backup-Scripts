- This script uses the mongodump command to create a dump of a MongoDB database. The mongodump command is a command-line utility for creating backups of MongoDB databases.

- The dest argument specifies the destination directory where the dump should be saved. The dumpdir variable specifies the name of the directory where the dump files will be stored (in this example, it is set to mongodb_backup).

- To use this script, save it to a file (e.g. mongodb_backup.sh), make it executable with chmod +x mongodb_backup.sh, and then run it with ./mongodb_backup.sh /path/to/destination.
